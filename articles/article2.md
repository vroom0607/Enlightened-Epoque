### **Fashion Trends Today**
Thanks to social media, fast fashion companies have been pushing new prints and designs into our shopping carts more rapidly than ever. Due to this mass advertisement, it may be tempting to jump on the latest trend and stock up on clothes we may never wear again. To avoid the dreaded “I have nothing to wear” state of panic, building a wardrobe of high-quality basics ensures a versatile collection that can sustain past trends.

### **Why Avoid Micro Trends?**
Microtrends are specific styles that gain and lose popularity quickly. Examples of fast fashion pieces we’ve seen in recent years are skinny jeans, bucket hats, and the infamous 2020 cow print. While these might feel like a must-have in the moment, following fads can be problematic for **these several reasons:**

- **High Cost:** Because of their short lifespan in the limelight, microtrends cause more frequent shopping trips among consumers. This leads to wasted hard-earned money spent on items that may not be worn more than a couple times before being abandoned.

- **Environmental Damage:** Fast fashion contributes significant harm to our planet due to overproduction and waste.

- **Lack of Longevity:** Trendy items are usually mass produced to meet the demands of consumers. Thus, the materials used may be of lower quality; in turn, they will be discarded quickly after few uses.

- **Overcomplicated Wardrobes:** A closet full of trends can feel both chaotic and useless, making it harder to put together cohesive outfits consistently. Trendy items don’t usually pair well with each other because they are almost always statement pieces, making them impractical for styling yourself everyday.

By avoiding microtrends, you save money, reduce negative impacts on our planet, and create a wardrobe that withstands the test of time.

### **The Power of High-Quality Basics**
Quality basics are the ultimate solution to these trends advertised all over social media. They form the foundation of a cohesive wardrobe and offer unlimited styling possibilities. **Key pieces to consider include:**

- **Neutral Tops:** Classic white, black, and gray long and short sleeves as well as tank and tube tops.

- **Versatile Outerwear:** A trench coat, denim jacket, or tailored blazer.

- **Timeless Bottoms:** Jeans, trousers, and skirts that are hemmed to suit your body type.

- **Classic Footwear:** White sneakers, loafers, and ankle boots that are (hopefully) comfortable to wear.

Investing in these staples ensures you’ll always have something stylish and appropriate for all occasions in your life!

### **Materials to Invest In**
The materials that our clothes, especially basics, are made out of matter more than you may think. It is wise to invest in high-quality material if you want to keep your items in pristine condition. Natural fibers tend to last longer, look better, and feel more comfortable against the skin compared to synthetic fabrics (The Essential Guide to Natural Fibers). **Here’s a quick guide to materials worth investing in and those to avoid:**

### **Invest:**
- **Cotton:** A common closet staple material like this is perfect for t-shirts, button-downs. Look for organic or Pima cotton for added softness and longevity (The Essential Guide to Natural Fibers).

- **Linen:** Being more lightweight and breathable, it prevents overheating–perfect for summer! It ages beautifully, becoming softer over time (8 Reasons to Switch to Natural Fiber Clothing).

- **Wool:** In contrast to linen, wool is known for its warmth. It is ideal for coats, sweaters, and other outwear that is cozy. Merino wool is a great option for softer, non-itchy knits (8 Reasons to Switch to Natural Fiber Clothing).

- **Cashmere:** Cousin to wool, cashmere is a luxurious fiber that’s soft and lightweight–all while keeping you warm too! While it can be an investment, well-cared-for cashmere pieces last for years to come (The Good Cashmere Standard).

- **Silk:** It is a common material that is used to make blouses, scarves, and dresses. Silk’s natural sheen and breathable fabric is both nice to wear and to show off (The Essential Guide to Natural Fibers).

### **Avoid:**
- **Polyester:** While durable and budget-friendly, polyester is not as breathable as natural fibers and can trap odors. It is less comfortable and less eco-friendly (Synthetics).

- **Nylon:** Popular among the fast fashion industry, nylon is prone to pilling and is not known to last for a long time. It’s also less breathable compared to natural fibers (Synthetics).

- **Acrylic:** Known as a cheaper alternative to wool, it lacks the warmth and longevity of its naturally sourced counterpart, which makes it feel rough or itchy (Synthetics).

- **Rayon/Viscose:** While semi-synthetic, these materials are prone to shrinking and can lose their shape after washing (The Essential Guide to Natural Fibers).

Investing in high-quality, natural materials not only improves the look and feel of your wardrobe but also decreases the amount of money spent on clothing, even if they may cost you more during the initial purchase. Think about it this way, in the long run, it’ll be less of a financial burden to keep a piece from a decade ago than it is to constantly buy cheap itchy clothing every 6 months. Prioritize these recommended fabrics for a sustainable, versatile wardrobe you’ll love forever.

Investing in basics reduces anxiety and simplifies outfits into sophisticated fashion, helping you achieve polished looks without the stress of keeping up with trends. These staples are key to always looking put-together and chic regardless of what you have ahead of you; timeless pieces ensure your style remains consistent, versatile, and true to who you are.
