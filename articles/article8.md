### __Accessories 101__
Accessories are meant to bring our whole outfit together. It’s easy to overthink or overdo them and lose track of the whole point of these additional items. Before stepping out the door, pause for a moment and ensure everything looks intentional. Do certain pieces divert attention instead of drawing awareness to the entire look? Keep reading to unlock simple tricks that can instantly upgrade any outfit!

### __Statement Pieces__
We all have that one stunning necklace or exaggerated pair of hoops sitting in our jewelry collection. And to that end, we all bought them for a reason. So why do they seem to be causing more trouble than good? Stylist Camille Chemla gives plain and simple advice that you may have overlooked: “If I’m wearing a statement piece on my neck, I won't wear anything too big in my ears — just studs or small huggies”. By doing so, you’ll keep your looks more streamlined and less overwhelming. Always make sure that your outfit has no more than 3 clear focal points. Any more than that may make your outfit look too chaotic or even messy. Sometimes, it may be a garment that draws attention so be sure to always take a quick glance in the mirror before departing on your excursions!

### __Matching Metals__
Though recently mixing and matching metals (especially gold and silver) have become more popularized, a tried and true tip is to wear the same type of metal throughout your outfit. In fact, if you want to take this even further, you can even curate your jewelry to match your belt buckle, the zipper of your purse, and the buttons of your coat. However, if this coordination feels too one-dimentional for your liking, integrating another metal to contrast sometimes does the trick. As long as the mixing comes off as intentional, your look will have symmetry and cohesion (Vogue). Take caution though! Any look with more than 2 metals might be harder to style without coming across as overwhelming.

### __Consider Your Environment__
Accessories should mirror the vibe of the event. Items like a glittery purse or excessive earrings may be inappropriate for more formal events or everyday office errands. In general, for more professional settings, opt for daintier jewelry and minimize wearing an excess of accessories overall. Voy Media says that wearing multiple stacks of rings or bracelets in a work environment may come off as overdone. 

### __Build Around Your Outfit__
This may seem like a straightforward approach, but it’s important nonetheless! Picture your clothes as the main course and your accessories as the appetizer, sides, and dessert. All the items before and after the main dish should complement it, not distracting from it right? Before stepping foot out the door, ensure that all your supporting accessories fit the aesthetic of the look you’re going for. If your outfit is more basic, you can add more items to add more personality to it. If your outfit is more eye-catching, consider opting for a simple bag and earrings. Balance is always key with styling. Nordstrom recommends keeping it simple and prioritizing practicality when you’re unsure of what to do to avoid visual noise.

### __Final Thoughts__
Accessorising isn't about overcrowding. It’s easy for us to get carried away with these items but when we take a step back and ground ourselves with intention, it’s easy to see that true style lies with being clever and logical. By grounding your look in 1-2 statement pieces, matching metals and colors with purpose, and building around your outfit, you create a look that’s harmonious and confident. It’s a common phrase heard in our lives by sometimes less is more!
