### **Why Use Accessories?**
Accessories have the power to elevate any outfit–even something as simple as a white T-shirt and crisp jeans. More importantly, they allow for our personality to shine through our fashion choices too. That’s why collecting timeless and durable pieces is just as crucial as investing in high-quality clothing pieces; by doing so, we reduce the cost-per-wear on all our jewelry as we will never have to consider replacing tarnishing metals. Still not convinced to initially splurge? Keep reading!

### **Why Jewelry Quality Matters**
Not all gold is created equal. Being a staple in many jewelry collections, it’s important to ensure those pieces last the test of time. Though the purest form is 24K, it is much too delicate and soft to wear everyday as you risk scratching and bending it (American Gem Society). **Here's a quick overview of the most common purities of gold in jewelry:**

- **14K:** An ideal balance of durability and gold content (58.3% pure gold), making it more resistant to scratches and great for daily wear.

- **18K:** A higher gold content (75% pure gold) but still durable enough for daily wear–although more caution should be taken.

- **24K:** 100% pure gold, but too malleable, making it impractical to sport regularly (Jewelry Shopping Guide).

Similar to gold, pure silver is also too fragile to be worn everyday, but there are still ideal percentages to look for in your items. For those that may prefer silver, **here’s your guide to its purity:**

- **Sterling Silver:** The best choice for sporting daily (92.5% Pure Silver, 7.5% Copper or Alloy), making it ideal for wearing daily–though regular polishing is needed to retain original shine. 

- **Fine Silver:** Composed of 99.9% pure silver and is impractical for regular occasions.

For long-term value, solid sterling silver (stamped 925) is the best investment as it lasts for decades with proper care (The Jewelry Guide).

### **Investing in Bags**
Bags are an underestimated essential that can both be practical and chic. While it may not be necessary to splurge on a satchel that is decorated in designer logos, it is just as important to opt for durable materials when shopping for bags as it is for jewelry. Investing in a bag made from thick, durable materials like leather or heavyweight canvas ensures a long lifespan of good use. Similar to clothes, trendy bags will always make their appearances in and out of the spotlight. However, it’s much more budget and environment friendly to purchase a high-quality satchel made with elite craftsmanship than it is to constantly upgrade to the next cheap, trendy purse. It’s always wise to drift towards classic styles and neutral colors because they pair with almost anything. As an extra bonus, if you do decide to acquire a designer purse, they may sometimes increase in value, earning you a profit if you ever decide to sell it. Of course, this is not to say that more color totes are off-limits. Once you have secured a bag for daily use, you can keep collecting a few more for more specific occasions (like a going out bag).

### **Why to Invest in Accessories**
In short, investing in accessories–jewelry or bags–offer 3 main benefits that their fast fashion counterparts cannot:

- **Durability:** High-quality materials withstand daily wear and retain their value.

- **Timeless Appeal:** Classic designs never go out of style, ensuring you always look polished.

- **Sustainability:** Investing in long-lasting accessories reduces waste and unnecessary consumption.

**Here’s an example of a scenario below:**

| Item                  | Fast-Fashion Cost | Investment Cost | Years of Wear | Cost per Wear     |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------|:------------------|:----------------|:-------------------|
| Gold-Plated Necklace  | $50               | -                | 6 months | ~$8.30/month      |
| 14K Solid Gold Necklace | -               | $500             | Lifetime       | ~$5/year          |

A solid gold or sterling silver necklace may cost more at first, but it will last a lifetime compared to fast-fashion jewelry, which tarnishes and needs to be replaced multiple times a year. 

**Another one that relates more to bags:**

| Item                  | Fast-Fashion Cost | Investment Cost | Years of Wear | Cost per Wear     |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------|:------------------|:----------------|:-------------------|
| Faux Leather Tote | $60               | -                | 1 year | ~$5/month     |
| Real Leather Tote | -               | $600             | 10+ years     | ~$5/year          |

### **Final Thoughts**
Beyond the factor of aesthetics, investing in well-crafted accessories is a must if we want to elevate any look you may choose to sport. After analyzing cost-per-wear outcomes of these investment pieces, we can see that there is 1 clear winner here: the high-quality necklace or the sturdy purse. Social media may convince us that having a large collection of jewelry or bags is the solution to preventing any fashion faux pas; however, the real antidote lies in purchasing timeless and durable items first. Since these pieces last for years to come, we can gradually build up a small but well-crafted rotation of accessories on hand. The trick is to avoid impulse spending and practice careful thought instead!
