### **Why Traditional Study Techniques Fail**
Passive reading, highlighting information in our notes, and shallow memorization feel productive but, in reality, do nothing to retain knowledge in the long run. Both neuroscientists and educational experts agree that these forms of studying result in a rapid degradation of memory retention while strategies that require our brains to actively work (like retrieval and spacing) produce more promising learning outcomes (University of York Subject Guides; Science Direct). Instead, let’s shift our focus that aligns with how our memory functions to decrease time spent studying while increasing material mastery. 

### **Proven Study Methods**
Pomodoro Method: A renowned technique that splits studying (usually 25 mins) with breaks (approximately ~5 mins) to avoid burnout, increase attention span, and enhance productivity (Verywell Mind). 

- **Active Recall:** A process by which you force your brain to retrieve certain information (with flashcards or practice questions) to stimulate exam-like settings (University of York Subject Guides; Goodnotes)

- **Spaced Repetition:** A system of intentionally spaced out review sessions that combat the “forgetting curve”, focusing on transferring information to your long-term memory. 

### **Why This Works**
Empirical research studies suggest that structured, self-monitored breaks (such as those found in the Pomodoro Method) positively impact your mood and task efficiency (PubMed). Furthermore, systematic reviews of active recall also strongly correlated this way to learning to better academic performance as well as self-efficacy (PubMed). Spaced repetition not only benefits long-term memory, but also boosts your short-term memory as well (PMC). A win-win for you all around!

### **Caveats for Consideration**
Always customize your study habits to YOU. For example, users of the Pomodoro Method should keep in mind that these breaks may impact your motivation negatively more than following less rigid break schedules (PMC, MDPI). This method is effective overall but you should consider your strengths and weaknesses when deciding what study method to use. Certain techniques will fare better with different people; it’s essential to explore different practices and retain the types that work under your personal circumstances. 

### **Final Thoughts**
Studying isn’t a one-size fits all approach but rather a trial-and-error to find the best blends of methods that work for us. Upon reading, let’s make a conscious effort to ditch the seemingly productive techniques for efficient and effective practices instead. Cheers to better memory, stellar grades, and a brighter future!
