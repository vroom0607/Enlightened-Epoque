### **Misunderstandings of Fashion**
Looking put together doesn’t require a closet full of clothes; it requires styling with logic and thought. Instead of focusing on the next big trend of the season, plan ahead smarter. We don’t need to waste hours on end knee-deep in our closets, as society seems to normalize. Let’s alter our viewpoint on fashion and styling to ensure we streamline our dressing routine for good!

### **The Sandwich Method**
This styling trick effectively simplifies how you go about curating balanced, cohesive outfits. As the name suggests, the main idea is to “sandwich” your outfit by matching your upper and bottom layers (usually in color) while your middle layer is a complementary tone to tie everything together (The Wardrobe Consultant). Thus, all your looks will look more thoughtful and visually appealing. **We’ve broken this strategy down step by step for you here:**

**1. Choose a Base Color**

Start with a neutral or monochromatic top, like a beige sweater, black t-shirt, or white button-down.

**2. Select a Contrasting Middle Layer**

Add a middle layer that’s different, like dark jeans, black pants, or pleated skirt.

**3. Repeat the Base Color for the Bottom Layer**

Match your shoes or accessories to your top layer (Byrdie).

**Here’s an example below:**

You create a visual balance that's cohesive by wearing the same color on the top and bottom. The middle layer is able to create a break between the similar hues you’re sporting, preventing outfits from looking repetitive and boring. This approach is highly versatile because it is simple enough to work for almost any event you’re attending. 

### **Staple Outfits: Your Style Safety Net**
When all else fails, make sure to have go-to outfits that you feel confident and secure in. Come up with 3-5 good combinations that ideally suit most activities in your life or designate 1 outfit per specific occasion if you prefer to be more orderly. This will significantly alleviate the stress of not having anything to wear and allow you to enjoy your life at the same time. Also, keep in mind that these staple rotations should always reflect the aesthetic you wish to surround your fashion around. Besides ensuring you always look polished, they also offer **additional benefits:**

- **Consistency:** Staple outfits always hammer home your personal style.

- **Efficiency:** They save time on busy mornings or when you're in a rush.

- **Adaptability:** They're easy to dress up or down with accessories or layering (Vogue, “How to Find Your Style”).

**If this backup plan interests you, these are some tips that help you get started:**

- **Start with Wardrobe Basics:** Make high-quality basics (white t-shirts, black trousers, tailored denim, fitted blazer, and neutral sweaters) the first item you pick out. These pieces form the foundation of your staple outfits (Vogue, “Capsule Wardrobe Essentials”).

- **Test and Refine Combinations:** Keep experimenting with different pairings to find the best possible core outfits–one that you can confidently strut in. Keep track of the ones that feel the most comfortable and flattering while still ensuring it fits your lifestyle.

- **Ensure Versatility:** Though tailoring an outfit to a particular event may be useful, especially if it is recurring, it is wiser to curate styles that can be worn to multiple common events in your life. This simplifies your decisions down more often, reducing stress. 

At the end of the day, these core outfits should be reflective of your personal taste and can truly be almost anything you feel confident in. For example, the image above showed a basic tank top with a pair of jeans. This works because you can add or remove an outer layer depending on the season by adding a cardigan or puffer jacket. **Here’s an example below:**

### **Why These Methods Work**
These 2 methods both focus on simple and sustainable outfits that ensure intentionality and versatility. These strategies target the stress behind fashion-related choices in our daily lives. 
These methods minimize decision fatigue, ensuring you always feel confident in your choices. By sticking to a curated selection of basics and using simple styling strategies, you can create endless combinations that look polished and cohesive (Vogue, “How to Find Your Style”).

### **Final Thoughts**
Looking put together doesn't have to be overwhelming; let’s reduce the clutter in our minds and closet by focusing on a different perspective. We have been tricked by society into believing curating an aesthetic outfit requires energy and time. Diverting our attention to building simple but cohesive looks prioritizes not only fashion, but also timelessness and consistency. Let’s all upgrade our lookbook for life!
