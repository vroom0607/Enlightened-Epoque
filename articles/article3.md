Some people follow the latest shoe drops like keeping up with the news while others may have never given their footwear a second thought after tying the laces. However, we cannot deny that shoes can make or break an outfit…and your health as well! Over ⅓ of the adult population wear incorrectly sized shoes, leading to foot issues, joint pain, and overall discomfort (The Sun). Not to fret though, this guide will break down the important factors that play a role in determining the right pair of shoes for you. Whether it be for work or an evening out, we’ve got you covered!

### **Factors to Consider**
Beyond the factor of aesthetics, long-lasting and high-quality footwear is a crucial aspect of your closet. Footwear you own should be pleasing to the eye of course but also durable and comfortable too. Here are some aspects of shoes to consider:

- **Comfort:** You won’t find yourself reaching for the most stylish pair of shoes if they’re painful to wear. Take note of how your feet feel when standing in them. Could you see yourself wearing these for hours on end? According to the American Podiatric Medical Association, shoes that don’t fit correctly or lack support can lead to long-term foot issues like bunions, plantar fasciitis, and back pain (APMA).

- **Materials:** Just like our clothes, it’s important to invest in natural materials, like leather or suede, for our shoes as well. Not only will they be more durable but they’ll also be more breathable as well.

- **Durability:** Going hand in hand with the materials of a pair of shoes, the composition of them is another important factor to consider. Shoes with sturdy stitching, quality soles, and reinforced heels will last longer, saving you money as an extra bonus too!

- **Versatility:** How well do your shoes integrate into your closet? Do they go with the majority of your outfits? It’s no good to invest in a pair of shoes you won’t reach for because they clash with your style. If you’re unsure, neutral tones are a good place to start!

- **Fit:** This might be an obvious one, but a survey by The Sun clearly disproves it! Always try on your shoes to make sure you feel 100% comfortable with walking around in them. If you see a pair online, make your way to an in-person store if you can before purchasing. If you can’t, make sure return policies are in place before ordering.

### **Staple Shoes**
- **White Sneakers:** Crisp, white sneakers are the most essential pair of shoes. They can be chunkier with a platform or thin and flatter. They don’t have to be pure white (like the Nike Air Force 1s) but should stray closer to neutral colorways to maximize wear with an abundance of outfits. According to Vogue, white sneakers have become a go-to staple for their ability to blend casual and polished aesthetics seamlessly. Think about it, white sneakers can be paired with jeans, dresses, and even formal pieces. Leather is an ideal material for this type of shoe.

- **Boots:** If you live in colder areas, boots are an essential to keep your feet warm. But even as a fashion statement, a black or brown pair can elevate a look entirely.

- **Pumps:** A pair of heels is perfect for any formal event or an evening out. You can opt for more classic colors (black, nude, etc) or go for more embellished items too. If you’re looking for more stability, thicker block heels or short kitten heels work just as well.

- **Sandals:** We’ve talked about prepping for colder weather, but what about warmer weather? Sandals are a great staple if you enjoy venturing out in the summer or taking vacations to the beach. Make sure to find a pair with a more cushioned sole to maximize comfort!

When you take the time to invest in a good footwear rotation, nothing can stop you from stepping out with style every day–with comfort and ease! A high-quality pair of shoes will prevent certain health conditions from arising and save you from constantly wasting money on multiple low-quality ones too.
