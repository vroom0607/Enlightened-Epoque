### **What is Motivation?**
The Oxford Dictionary defines motivation as “the mental processes that direct, sustain, and arouse human behavior.” It’s an essential element that has guaranteed our survival and evolution as a species. When we were hungry, we were motivated to hunt. When we were thirsty, we were motivated to quench our thirst. But this relationship isn’t as straightforward for more abstract and secondary goals.

### **Motivation in Society**
Today our goals and realities are a lot more complex than just merely survival. All around us, motivation is celebrated as the driving force behind success. We see motivational speeches, books, and quotes plastered across social media, promising to reignite our drive and help us conquer anything life throws at us. Unfortunately, those people are only partially correct. Recent research from Yale University proves that “goals are more likely to be successful in the long term if they’re intrinsically motivated.” Yet, if you’ve ever relied solely on motivation to achieve a goal, you’ve likely experienced some burnout and noticed how quickly it fades. The secret to long-lasting success isn’t motivation&mdash;it’s identity.

### **Problem with Motivation**
Motivation is unstable and short-lived. It’s often influenced by external circumstances, moods, or energy levels, making it unreliable for success in the long run. Once a shift in our mood occurs, there will be fluctuations with our levels of motivation, ruining our progress towards our goals. Research from the National Institute of Health (NIH) shows that motivation peaks when we set new goals but quickly diminishes as the initial excitement wears off. In fact, “by mid-February, according to the U.S. News & World Report, most people have lost their commitment and overall, the failure rate is 80% for those resolutions!” (NIH). Maybe you’ve identified with the 80% as well in the past. This year, it’s time to try something new!

### **Advantages of Identity Shifts**
Instead of solely relying on bursts of motivation, try shifting who you see yourself as. For example, say your goal is to go to the gym more. Instead of saying, “I want to workout,” shift your thinking to, “I am an active and healthy person.” Though subtle, this shift makes your goal more achievable because not just something you do occasionally&mdash;it's part of your identity. This is where motivation plays its part: by encouraging yourself to go to the gym because it doesn’t want to disprove something ingrained in your personality. Thus, in this scenario, you will be more motivated to workout and achieve better outcomes. In Atomic Habits, James Clear emphasizes this point: “The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say, ‘I’m the type of person who wants this.’ It’s something very different to say, ‘I’m the type of person who is this.’” Similarly, Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit, explains how identity plays a critical role in habit formation: “When people believe in their ability to change&mdash;and believe in habits aligned with their identity&mdash;it creates a framework for achieving lasting results.” The key takeaway here is that identity based habits are our transportation to achieving our destination or goal.

### **How to Shift Your Identity**
The following practical steps will help you to focus on identity rather than motivation:

- **Decide Who You Wish to Be:** Specify the type of person who achieves the goals you’re pursuing. Back to our previous example, if your goal is to go to the gym more, your identity shift might be, “I am someone who prioritizes health.”

- **Focus on Minor Achievements:** Each time you take an action that supports your new identity, you reinforce it. Following the same example, completing a single workout reinforces the identity of being someone who trains their body.

- **Use Identity-Based Affirmations:** Try saying “I am someone who never misses a workout,” instead of “I’ll try to work out 3x this week.” Your perspective may subtly change and positively impact your mindset.

- **Surround Yourself with Reinforcements:** Ensure your environment and community are in alignment with who you want to become. For example, joining a running club can help solidify your identity as someone who values fitness.

- **Be Patient and Consistent:** It takes time to change your identity. More decisions that support your new identity will help ease this transition.

### **Why This Works**
Behaviors that are part of your identity become automatic. If you identify as someone who values learning, questioning your surroundings or researching a specific topic in your free time becomes second nature. Identity sets the table for consistency, which ultimately leads to success. As James Clear says, “every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.” Research from Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck further supports the concept of identity-based growth. Dweck’s studies show that adopting a growth mindset&mdash;the belief that you can improve and grow from challenges&mdash;is crucial to being successful in achieving goals.

### **Closing Thoughts**
Though motivation is a positive kickstart to achieving our goals, it will never be the reliable foundation that society makes it out to be. In order to achieve meaningful change, focus on shifting your identity and aligning your actions with the person you aspire to become instead. This approach not only maintains your efforts but also makes the journey less grueling and more fulfilling. We all can accomplish what we dream of by shifting our actions to match our identity throughout our journey!
