### **What is Color Theory?**
Color theory is the study of how colors interact, combine, and affect human perception. Being a foundational element in almost anything, color plays a huge role in how our clothes, shoes, accessories, and even hair are seen by others. Mastering the ability to style yourself using hues that complement ourselves is crucial to looking sophisticated, elegant, and overall pleasing to the eye. This theory allows us to create visually cohesive looks that leave a positive impression lingering in any room we walk into.

### **The Importance of Color Theory**

- **Caters Outfits to You:** Color theory prevents your clothes or hair from clashing with one another and also helps to identify which ones compliment your features the best. The color wheel–which includes complementary, analogous, and monochromatic color schemes–serves as a guide for creating visually pleasing ensembles (99designs). 

- **Brings Out Natural Features:** Certain colors will brighten your skin, bring out the color of your eyes, and overall bring more radiance to yourself. Others may wash you out and make you look duller. To prevent this, it’s important to assess your personal seasonal color analysis (keep reading to learn how!).

- **Facilitates Shopping and Outfit Planning:** Instead of blindly hopping on the new trendy color of the season, identify what colors and hues suit you the best. Masting color theory is both a smart and budget-friendly hack that will simplify shopping and curate a cohesive wardrobe. 

- **Affects Mood and Perception:** Have you ever heard that wearing red can make you more attractive? Certain shades can influence others’ image of you and identifying the right colors for different occasions allows you to control the tone of how you want to be perceived (PALO Creative). 

### **Seasonal Color Analysis**
Previously mentioned above, one of the best ways to determine what colors suit you the best is through this method. Most people fit into 1 of 4 seasons. Here’s a step-by-step guide to walk you through identifying your seasonal color palette!
First, determine your undertones:

- **Warm Undertones:** Golden or peachy skin tones, greenish veins, gold jewelry looks better.

- **Cool Undertones:** Pink or bluish skin tones, blue veins, silver jewelry looks better.

- **Neutral Undertones:** A mix of warm and cool tones, with blue-green veins. Both gold and silver jewelry suit you well.

**Then, match with a season:**

- **Spring (Warm & Light):** Suits peach, coral, warm pastels, and ivory.

- **Summer (Cool & Light):** Looks best in pastels, rose, and soft neutrals.

- **Autumn (Warm & Deep):** Rich earth tones like mustard, terracotta, and olive work well.

- **Winter (Cool & Deep):** Best with bold, high-contrast colors like navy, black, and jewel tones.
