### **Importance of Sleep**
Sleep, specifically high-quality sleep, is essential in maintaining our physical and mental wellbeing. Though it may feel passive, many of our essential organs and systems undergo vital restoration processes to help us thrive for the next day and beyond. Understanding how our bodies protect us can help us cooperate with our biological systems, not fight back against it and overall empower ourselves to be better each day. 

### **Circadian Rhythm**
Do you ever wonder what influences the time of day you are awake and asleep? It’s primarily influenced by your circadian rhythm, 24 hour cycles that affect how your physiological processes function at specific times of day. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain is the main regulator behind this biological clock. How does your brain know when to activate and deactivate your different organ systems you ask? Through light wave response of course! Before modern technology, the only light source humans, and other animals, had access to was the sun. So we performed survival activities during the day and rested at night. However, now, many disruptions — from irregular sleep to artificial light — can confuse our internal rhythm and ultimately negatively impact our health (Cleveland Clinic). 

### **Sleep Debt**
Financial debt is not the only type of debt you need to worry about; before bank accounts and credit scores, the accumulation of lack of sleep proved to cause harm to those who fell victim to sleep debt. Formally defined, sleep debt is the cumulative deficit between the amount of sleep you need and the amount you actually get. This can have lasting harmful effects: chronic sleep deprivation can lead to cognitive impairments, mood disturbances, and increased risk for various health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes (Cleveland Clinic). Even worse, simply catching up on sleep may not be enough to fully offset these impacts on your health, especially concerns surrounding metabolic well-being (Cleveland Clinic). However, it can still prevent future problems from arising and stabilize energy levels to some extent, so it is still important to alter poor sleep habits starting now!

### **Tips on Getting Good Sleep**
Here are some ideas to get a headstart to fixing your sleep!

- **Stay Consistent with a Sleep Schedule:** Try to sleep and wake up around the same time no matter the occasion! (Mayo Clinic). This will ease the pain of early mornings and the restless tosses and turns at night!

- **Revamp Your Sleepspace:** Maintain a cool, quiet, and dark environment; consider investing in blackout curtains, earplugs, or white noise machines (Real Simple)

- **Adjust Your Portions:** Heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol towards the hours leading up to your bedtime can disrupt sleep (Mayo Clinic).

- **Create a Routine:** Find calming activities, such as reading, meditating, or taking a warm bath, to ease your body and mind into a restful state (Yale School of Medicine).

- **Stay Active:** Moving your body in the daytime will help the body differentiate between daytime and nighttime; try to keep heavy or intense workouts from bedtime hours (Mayo Clinic).

- **Address Stressors:** Add in any stress-relieving techniques (journaling, deep breathing, or mindfulness) before bedtime (Mayo Clinic).

### **Final Thoughts**
Being such an important aspect of our everyday lives, it’s essential to prioritize sleep as much as maintaining a healthy diet or staying fit. Being well-rested each day is a step in the right direction towards a happier, healthier, and harmonious life. Don’t get caught up focusing on perfection: life happens. Instead, focus on consistency.  Let’s continue to foster healthy sleep patterns by preserving healthy sleep hygiene habits at all times!
