### **Safety First**
The last thing we want is more stress during our vacations. That is why it is crucial to plan for immediate dangers or threats at our destinations. The US Department of State suggests registering with STEP (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program), keeping physical and digital copies of personal information, and avoiding grand displays of wealth. **Here are some key safety tips to stick to:**

- **Take Anti-Theft Precautions:** Consider swapping handbags for cross body satchels.

- **Use VPN:** Public Wi-Fi may pose a risk to your private information.

- **Stay Vigilant:** Be on the lookout for any threats at all times. Tourists are at greater risk of danger.

- **Memorize Emergency Numbers:** Keep local police and hotel addresses on hand.

- **Invest in Travel Insurance:** Compensate your vacation if needed; over 30% of travelers had to cancel or delay trips due to unforeseen circumstances (Forbes Advisor).

### **Travel Light**
The biggest tip is to pack smart and minimally. Overpacking is the easiest way to negatively impact your vacation before it even begins. Heavy suitcases only impede your progress and lead to extra airline fees as well (Bruning). So it’s time to lighten the load and rewire the approach to pretravel preparation. But how? The answers are here now! 
Stick to a Color Palette: Packing items that go with each other significantly reduces the amount of individual items brought but keeps the number of outfits able to be created at an all time high. Even overseas, the importance of a timeless wardrobe never fades!

- **Organize Effectively:** Roll up clothes to reduce the room they take up. Invest in packing cubes. Play with different strategies and find the one that works for the specific circumstance.

- **Stick to the Basics:** No more “just in case items”! If an unlikely situation does occur, there will be shops at any destination to shop at! Of course, this excludes basic medical equipment; don’t gamble with health at the expense of a lighter suitcase.

Less packing = Less organizing. A win-win for everyone!

### **Maximizing Fun**
After ensuring your safety and efficiency, it’s time to tackle vacation planning. The good news? It’s entirely up to you. The bad news? It’s entirely up to you. Here are some universal rules to adhere to when planning out your ultimate getaway!

- **Talk to Locals:** Not only can these interactions make your trip feel more genuine, but you often learn about the best spots and attractions around that destination.

- **Plan Flexibly:** Cramming too many activities in one day may lead to feelings of stress, which is the exact opposite of what you want on your vacation! Leave a generous amount of time between each event on the to-do list.

- **Experience over Souvenirs:** Spend more money on present moment pursuits than just simple magnets or postcards. Keeping footage or pictures of your trip and saving money on other artifacts also serves as an important memento as well!

- **Prioritize Health:** Make sure the water you drink is clean, your hotel and surrounding area is safe, and try to beat any jetlag immediately. The Mayo Clinic recommends trying to sleep according to the specific destination’s time zone a few days before departure. Studies have shown that traveling can improve mental health by lowering stress and boosting creativity (Gilbert); in turn, it's recommended to ensure both physical health is in good shape too!

### **Cultural Sensitivity**
As travelers, it's crucial to be aware of traditional customs, whether they align with our beliefs or not. We are stepping foot into their home and we should treat it with dignity and respect. Let’s leave the local population a positive impression of us tourists. Simple gestures — from following cultural customs and dress codes to learning their etiquette and language — go a long way. The United Nations World Tourism Organization also highly suggests to us travelers to reduce our carbon footprint by taking public transportation, supporting local businesses, and steering away from overtouristed destinations if at all possible.

### **Closing Thoughts**
Traveling can make more than memories; it can build connection and foster growth. Exploring the world with the people we love doesn’t have to be difficult or a burden at all. Let’s stay safe, pack smart, and immerse ourselves in the many beautiful cultures and places Earth has to offer.
