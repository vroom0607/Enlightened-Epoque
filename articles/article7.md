### **How to Pair Shoes with Your Day**
**Below are some basic situations that occur in our lives, along with suggested shoe recommendations:**

- **Casual Everyday Errands**
**Best Footwear:** Structured shoes or dad shoes.
These versatile options pair well with jeans, leggings, or casual dresses. Go for minimal designs for easy styling, or choose fun textures or colors to add interest to a simple outfit. Stick to neutral tones if you're building a capsule wardrobe (Vogue Fashion Editors). Personal favorite pairs are the New Balance 530s or Adidas Sambas!

- **Office and Business Casual Settings**
**Best Footwear:** Loafers, boots, or mules.
Especially in leather or suede, these choices help to elevate professional outfits when paired  with tailored trousers, midi skirts, or a structured dress for a complete look. Opt for neutral tones like black, tan, or taupe since they can be paired with anything! (Harper’s Bazaar Editors).

- **Formal or Evening Events**
**Best Footwear:** Sandals, flats, or boots.
With more elevated outfits, strappy or structured heels add a boost of height and elegance to your look. Ballet flats also work well with jumpsuits as well as flowy bottoms. Make sure you choose a shoe that balances your outfit’s silhouette and provides comfort for longer wear!

- **Athletic Activities**
**Best Footwear:** Tennis or dad shoes.
When comfort and performance matter, the quality of the athletic sneaker matters. Pair these shoe recommendations with other athleisure like leggings and a sweatshirt or bike shorts and a tank top. Choose footwear based on your intended activity because different shoes sustain different results (running, walking, gym, etc.) (American Podiatric Medical Association). Once again, the New Balance 530s are still a tried and true recommendation!

- **Summer or Beach Days**
**Best Footwear:** Strappy sandals or slides.
Paired with long, breezy dresses or pants, anything with an open toe is great for warm or beach-like weather. Styling sandals that are either a metallic or neutral color will work with the most amount of styles in your wardrobe. 

- **Cold Weather**
**Best Footwear:** Boots or loafers.
Anything lined or waterproof is a great option in the late autumn or winter. Style them with leggings, long coats, or cozy sweaters. Especially in places that have snow, make sure to prioritize grip for safety! Try to opt for neutral tones since owning multiple colors of winter shoes may be too much for a shorter period of the year (unless you live in a place that is cold year round of course). UGGs or Doc Martens have various styles and designs to fit anyone!

### **Tips for Matching Shoes to Outfits**
- **Balance Proportions:** Chunkier shoes match better with structured or oversized pieces, while sleek shoes go with flowy or fitted outfits.

- **Match Tones:** Shoes don’t need to match the color of your outfit exactly (imagine the amount of shoes you would need!). As long as you feel the shoes either tie in with a piece in your outfit above (Sandwich Method) or are a neutral, classic color, the overall look will feel cohesive.

- **Socks:** Usually white ankle or crew socks tie everything together quite nicely.

### **Final Thoughts**
Being able to pick out a nice pair of shoes that compliment your outfit is just as important as having a put-together outfit in the first place. Not only does the right footwear typically make executing tasks in our lives easier, they also aid us in feeling chic and dressed with intention. Thoughtful footwear choices not only express your personal style but also ensure comfort and function. Style smart from the ground up (GQ Editors).
